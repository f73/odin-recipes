    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      When the calendar flips to fall and the weather starts to cool down, I
      always get a wave of requests for hearty soups and stews. This is an
      always-welcomed annual occurrence. One such request was for an updated
      lentil soup recipe, which is what I was brainstorming when the idea for
      Green Lentil “Gumbo” Soup came to mind. I’ll often have some type of food
      show on the TV as I work, mostly as background noise, but once in a while
      something will catch my eye that eventually inspires a video.

      This time it was a PBS show featuring Dooky Chase’s famous Gumbo z'herbes.
      This Holy Thursday dish is legendary (and one day I’ll share a version),
      but after watching, I decided to try a lentil soup featuring the
      ingredients and flavor profile of a classic gumbo. It turned out to be
      incredible. Using lentils to thicken the soup instead of a “roux” made for
      something much lighter, yet still very satisfying and comforting.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>8 ounces andouille sausage, cut into 1/4-inch cubes</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 cup diced onion</li>
      <li>1 cup diced green bell pepper</li>
      <li>2/3 cup diced celery</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>1 bay leaf</li>
      <li>6 cups no-salt or low-sodium chicken broth</li>
      <li>8 ounces chicken thighs, cut into small pieces</li>
      <li>4 ounces smoked ham, diced</li>
      <li>3/4 cup sliced fresh or frozen okra</li>
      <li>1 cup green lentils, rinsed</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon Louisiana-style hot sauce</li>
      <li>1/4 cup chopped Italian parsley</li>
      <li>1/3 cup sliced green onions</li>
      <li>2 cups cooked white rice (optional)</li>
      <li>1/3 cup sliced green onions, or as needed</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Add andouille to a dry soup pot and place over medium heat. Cook,
        stirring, until sausage begins to brown, a few minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add all the olive oil, unless a lot of fat was rendered from the
        sausage, in which case adjust the amount of oil added.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add onion, green pepper, celery, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring,
        until onions turn translucent, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add paprika, cumin, black pepper, thyme, oregano, and bay leaf. Cook,
        stirring, for 2 minutes more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in broth, raise heat to high, and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to
        medium low and stir in chicken, ham, and sliced okra.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook for 10 minutes, then stir in lentils. Simmer soup, stirring
        occasionally, until lentils are tender, about 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, parsley, and green onions, and
        cook for another few minutes. Season to taste with salt. Serve with
        rice, more green onions, and a shake of cayenne.
